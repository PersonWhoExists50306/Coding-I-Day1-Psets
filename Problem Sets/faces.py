# Goal: Print some faces and shapes! 

"""
Background: Let’s quickly play around with print! 
            To do so, let’s create python programs that print 
            the following faces and objects using only one print statement!
Your Mission: 
    In a file called faces.py use only one print statement per 
    face to print the following!
Face 0: 
:P
Face 1:
^  ^
____
Face 2: 
' '
 .
~~~
Face 3 (Gameboy): 
 ___
|[_]|
|+ ;|
`---'
Face 4 (Toilet): 
     _
    | |
 ___| |
